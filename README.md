## Introduction
> You need to validate things with your customers early and often in order tok eep learning.

Lean UX revolves around the idea of **validating hypotheses** rather than being the designer's purely creative endeavor. Use user interviews and reaserch to develop a hypothesis about what a customer might want and then test it to see you were right.

The problem of traditional approaches is that the process *starts with the feature rather than the hypohesis*. As an example, Laura uses a "Wall of comments" that the company wants to build for their product, however, the motivation behind it is shallow: we need to display comments. In a hypothesis based approach, the example turns into "we need to improve revenue and data/research has lead us to believe that allowing users to leave comments on product pages will cause them to become more negaged and buy more items. **How can we figure out if that true?**"

This approach creates a higher motivation, a bigger objective to tackle which can be achieved in multiple ways by different features.

> Lean UX isnt' about adding features to a product. It's about figuring out which metrics drive a business, understanding what customer problems we can solve to improve those metrics, generating ideas for fixing those customer problems, and then validating wether or not we were correct.

### Lean UX is Infomed by Data
Lean UX doesn't assume that a new design of feature is better than what came before it. Feature cycles don't end when the feature is relased to production. That just means it's ready to be tested and for its next iteration.
> By testing every iteration of a feature's design, we help the designed learn more about real user behavior.

# Part One: Validation

>The important thing is that you validate your idea --all of your ideas, really -- before you jum pin and start building your product.

## Chapter one: Early validation
Key concepts:
1. A market is a groupo of people you think might want to buy your producto. 
2. A problem is the reason those people are going to use your product.
3. A product is simply the way that you're going to solve the users's problem. 

1. Problem validation is something you do to reduce the uncertainty of an idea. Early validation will help you refine your ideas and learn more about your users.
2. Market validation is narrowing down the specific people who might want a soluiton to the problem you've validated.
3. Validating the product is the most time consuming process. 

> Does this product really solve the identified problem for the specific market? You'll know you've validated your product when a large percentage of your target market offers to pay you money to solve their problem

### Types of user research.
#### Etnographic studies
(Listening to your users)

Get to know the people for whom you're building a product.
1. Ask open-ended questions about their problems and their lifes. What's their current solution for the problem?
2. Don't ask (or don't get biased by) how a process is done. Ask about the situations that revolve around the process or, better yet, watch the people go through the process. You may find patters, or better yet, you may not find any (which cries for standarization)
3. Learn why they do things a certain way.
4. Learn about their current practices and patterns. You want to build products that fit seamlessly into people's exsisting processses.

##### How to

1. Find a good market segment

**Good and bad segment examples**

| Segment                                              |               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- |:-------------:|
| Women                                                | Bad           |
| People who process payroll for small businesses      | Good!         |
| Drivers                                              | Bad           |
| NASCAR drivers                                       | Good!         |
| Suburban driving grandmothers                        | Good!         |

2. Find 5 people who fit in the segment. If you can't easily find them, your segment might be too specific or too hard to reach.
3. Visit them or Skype/Facetime.
4. Ask them to show you the tasks they perform to solve the problem.
5. Ask them why they're doing things in a particular way.
6. Ask them which other things they have tried to solve the problem

*** What to look for ***
1. Get a good overview of their current practices
2. Spot patterns of behavior
3. Is there a specific problem encountered by each of the test participants?
4. Have they all complained about a paticular piece of software? Are they all performing tasks in specific way that could 
be made easier?

> The single greatest mistake you can make at this point is to start off by telling the test subject what you're working on and how great it will be for him. Nothing will bias a session faster than you trying to sell him on your ideas. You're not there to talk. You're there to listen.

> Here's the best possible way for you to try to figure out if your idea solves somebody's problem Show them something and observe their reactions. 

**Prototype testing**

Rather than pitching your idea to poeple:
1. Show them a prototype and watch them react to it. It's very easy for people to imagine a solution after your pitch but it will be far off from your product.
2. Make it interactive enough so they can imagine they're using a real product

> Even at high fidelity, an interactive prototype still takes far less time to build than an actual product.

#### Pain driven design

Clients can't predict the future and they're not the source of truth. Using User Centered Design doesn't mean the customer's always right and they have the solution to all of your problems. Making users talk about their problems and pain points can spark creativity in designers to develop better solutions.

**Becoming a doctor**

Pain driven design is like being a doctor. As a doctor, you don't ask people about their disease. You ask them about:

1. Their habits
2. What hurts
3. When does it hurt
4. Things that the patient about symptoms they may haven't noticed
5. Their likes and disliked
6. Their family and surroundings

That way you can diagnose a disease, develop a course of treatment and **follow its evolution**.

## Chapter two: The right sort of research at the right time

> If you don't have time to do user reserach, you'd better make time to fix your product once you've built it wrong, because I guarantee that is what's going to happen. The fact is, you don't have time *not* to do research.

> If you're doing the right sort of research at the righ time, you will end up saving time and money.

### Competitor testing

Go test what the competition does. No competition? Weird... but go find the next best thing. They must be screwing something up. Find it and fix it for your product.

**How to do it**
Part 1:

1. Find 4 or 5 users that use your competitors product.
2. Schedule a meeting/skype call.
3. Watch them use their product.

Part 2: Ask them some questions. Here are some examples

1. What do you like about the product?
2. What do you hate about it?
3. What confuses you about it?
4. What do you find particularly annoying about it?
5. What's missing from it?
6. Where did you hear about it?
7. Have you tried anything else like it?
8. Why did you pick this particular product over other options?

### Five Second tests
> You'd be shocked by how many users have literally no idea who you are, what your product is, or why they should be using it.  The horrifying thing is, they often feel this way after they've seen your actual product.

Ask your clients what it is they think you do. **This is greatly influcenced by your landing page**. It's your first and almost always your only chance to convert a visit into revenue.

> The goal of your landing pages is to convert the right kind of visitors into users. 

Ask these questions to potential clients or random people at a cafe:

1. What does the user think this product does? (Messaging) What does this product do?
2. Who does the user think the product is for? (Branding) Who is this product for?
3. Can the user figure out how to get the product? (CTA) What would you do if you came to this page on the recommendation of a friend or after clicking an ad?

Always follow up with WHY after each question. Always remember to buy them something in return ;)

### Clickable prototype testing

When is this the best choice? When you're creating a confusing, frustrating or complicated interaction. 
When is it not? When an engineer can built it almost as fast or faster in code. Like a landing page.

There are many gray areas but here are some pointer as to when you should create an interactive prototype:

> 1. For some reason, it will be difficult to change it in production if you got it wrong --for example, you're shipping software ina box or building a physical product.
> 2. Your finished product could kill someone or otherwise have a terrible outcome if it's wrong--for example, you're building a medical device or an election ballot.
> 3. The expected user flow is more complicated than a single click or call-to-action--for example, the user has to move thorugh several states or input various pireces of information, each of which may affect later decisons.
> 4. You have engineers who will be upset if they have to throw all their work because you designed it wrong--for example, every enegneer I have ever met.

**How to do it**
1. Make an interavtive prototype. Use HTML & JS, Axure, Adobe XD, Invision. Pick something where you can create and iterate quickly. Use a tool built for the job, NOT POWERPOINT!
2. Decide who to interview and which tasks they should perform.


**Things Laura Klein tests**
1. Signup flows that have more than one step
2. Purchase flows
3. Searching and browsing experiences
4. Sharing experiences (taking a picture, leaving a comment)
5. File upload and editing
6. Navigation of the entire product
7. PHysical buttons on products that aren't entirely screen based
8. Installation for products that require any kind of setup.
9. Anything else that requires more than one or two steps

3. Make 3 to 5 people navigate and test it. Make them perform the tasks you listed.

> Once you've identified a few major problems that users are having while completing the tasks, fix the prototype and do it all again. Keep iterating until users are able to complete most tasks themselves.

Pro tip: If you have multiple versions, ask your test users to complete all tasks in all prototypes but show them in random order.

### Guerilla user tests

Cheap | Fast | Actionable. Excelente for finding major usability flows in they key parts of your product. Use it to test new user problems (onboarding, messaging, early conversion)

Load your prototype, actual product or competition's product in a laptop or tablet, go to the nearest coffee shop, offer someone a drink and let them look at it for 10 mins.

1. Give the subject just the data they would know if they arrived there on their own.
2. Give them one task to acomplish.
3. Don't give any context or explain your product.
4. Listen to the questions they pose but don't answer them
5. Ask how they think they did accomplishing the task.
6. Repeat!

By the 4th or 5th iteration, you should have enough data to identify major usability flaws. If there are, iterate the prototype and start over.

> One word of caution: You can't actually learn wether people will like your product this way. You can only figure out if people understand your product. But, flankly, that's a pretty important thing to know.
