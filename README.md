# UX for Lean Startups
Notes for Laura Klein's book on UX: UX for Lean Startups

These are my takes on Laura Klein's book. This is meant to be a quick reference on key concepts but by no means a replacement for the book itself. By all means, go buy Laura's book here --> https://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research/dp/1449334911/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1520170438&sr=8-2&keywords=ux+for+lean+startups

## Introduction
> You need to validate things with your customers early and often in order tok eep learning.

Lean UX revolves around the idea of **validating hypotheses** rather than being the designer's purely creative endeavor. Use user interviews and reaserch to develop a hypothesis about what a customer might want and then test it to see you were right.

The problem of traditional approaches is that the process *starts with the feature rather than the hypohesis*. As an example, Laura uses a "Wall of comments" that the company wants to build for their product, however, the motivation behind it is shallow: we need to display comments. In a hypothesis based approach, the example turns into "we need to improve revenue and data/research has lead us to believe that allowing users to leave comments on product pages will cause them to become more negaged and buy more items. **How can we figure out if that true?**"

This approach creates a higher motivation, a bigger objective to tackle which can be achieved in multiple ways by different features.

> Lean UX isnt' about adding features to a product. It's about figuring out which metrics drive a business, understanding what customer problems we can solve to improve those metrics, generating ideas for fixing those customer problems, and then validating wether or not we were correct.

### Lean UX is Infomed by Data
Lean UX doesn't assume that a new design of feature is better than what came before it. Feature cycles don't end when the feature is relased to production. That just means it's ready to be tested and for its next iteration.
> By testing every iteration of a feature's design, we help the designed learn more about real user behavior.

# Part One: Validation

>The important thing is that you validate your idea --all of your ideas, really -- before you jum pin and start building your product.

## Chapter one: Early validation
Key concepts:
1. A market is a groupo of people you think might want to buy your producto. 
2. A problem is the reason those people are going to use your product.
3. A product is simply the way that you're going to solve the users's problem. 

1. Problem validation is something you do to reduce the uncertainty of an idea. Early validation will help you refine your ideas and learn more about your users.
2. Market validation is narrowing down the specific people who might want a soluiton to the problem you've validated.
3. Validating the product is the most time consuming process. 

> Does this product really solve the identified problem for the specific market? You'll know you've validated your product when a large percentage of your target market offers to pay you money to solve their problem

### Types of user research.
#### Etnographic studies
(Listening to your users)

Get to know the people for whom you're building a product.
1. Ask open-ended questions about their problems and their lifes. What's their current solution for the problem?
2. Don't ask (or don't get biased by) how a process is done. Ask about the situations that revolve around the process or, better yet, watch the people go through the process. You may find patters, or better yet, you may not find any (which cries for standarization)
3. Learn why they do things a certain way.
4. Learn about their current practices and patterns. You want to build products that fit seamlessly into people's exsisting processses.

##### How to

1. Find a good market segment

**Good and bad segment examples**

| Segment                                              |               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- |:-------------:|
| Women                                                | Bad           |
| People who process payroll for small businesses      | Good!         |
| Drivers                                              | Bad           |
| NASCAR drivers                                       | Good!         |
| Suburban driving grandmothers                        | Good!         |

2. Find 5 people who fit in the segment. If you can't easily find them, your segment might be too specific or too hard to reach.
3. Visit them or Skype/Facetime.
4. Ask them to show you the tasks they perform to solve the problem.
5. Ask them why they're doing things in a particular way.
6. Ask them which other things they have tried to solve the problem

*** What to look for ***
1. Get a good overview of their current practices
2. Spot patterns of behavior
3. Is there a specific problem encountered by each of the test participants?
4. Have they all complained about a paticular piece of software? Are they all performing tasks in specific way that could 
be made easier?

> The single greatest mistake you can make at this point is to start off by telling the test subject what you're working on and how great it will be for him. Nothing will bias a session faster than you trying to sell him on your ideas. You're not there to talk. You're there to listen.

> Here's the best possible way for you to try to figure out if your idea solves somebody's problem Show them something and observe their reactions. 

**Prototype testing**

Rather than pitching your idea to poeple:
1. Show them a prototype and watch them react to it. It's very easy for people to imagine a solution after your pitch but it will be far off from your product.
2. Make it interactive enough so they can imagine they're using a real product

> Even at high fidelity, an interactive prototype still takes far less time to build than an actual product.

#### Pain driven design

Clients can't predict the future and they're not the source of truth. Using User Centered Design doesn't mean the customer's always right and they have the solution to all of your problems. Making users talk about their problems and pain points can spark creativity in designers to develop better solutions.

**Becoming a doctor**

Pain driven design is like being a doctor. As a doctor, you don't ask people about their disease. You ask them about:

1. Their habits
2. What hurts
3. When does it hurt
4. Things that the patient about symptoms they may haven't noticed
5. Their likes and disliked
6. Their family and surroundings

That way you can diagnose a disease, develop a course of treatment and **follow its evolution**.

## Chapter two: The right sort of research at the right time

> If you don't have time to do user reserach, you'd better make time to fix your product once you've built it wrong, because I guarantee that is what's going to happen. The fact is, you don't have time *not* to do research.

> If you're doing the right sort of research at the righ time, you will end up saving time and money.
