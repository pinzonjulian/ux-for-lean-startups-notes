Notes for Laura Klein's book on UX: UX for Lean Startups

These are my takes on Laura Klein's book. This is meant to be a quick reference on key concepts but by no means a replacement for the book itself.

## Introduction
> You need to validate things with your customers early and often in order tok eep learning.

Lean UX revolves around the idea of **validating hypotheses** rather than being the designer's purely creative endeavor. Use user interviews and reaserch to develop a hypothesis about what a customer might want and then test it to see you were right.

The problem of traditional approaches is that the process *starts with the feature rather than the hypohesis*. As an example, Laura uses a "Wall of comments" that the company wants to build for their product, however, the motivation behind it is shallow: we need to display comments. In a hypothesis based approach, the example turns into "we need to improve revenue and data/research has lead us to believe that allowing users to leave comments on product pages will cause them to become more negaged and buy more items. **How can we figure out if that true?**"

This approach creates a higher motivation, a bigger objective to tackle which can be achieved in multiple ways by different features.

> Lean UX isnt' about adding features to a product. It's about figuring out which metrics drive a business, understanding what customer problems we can solve to improve those metrics, generating ideas for fixing those customer problems, and then validating wether or not we were correct.

### Lean UX is Infomed by Data
Lean UX doesn't assume that a new design of feature is better than what came before it. Feature cycles don't end when the feature is relased to production. That just means it's ready to be tested and for its next iteration.
> By testing every iteration of a feature's design, we help the designed learn more about real user behavior.
